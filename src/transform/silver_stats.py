"""Per-run transform stats: what the silver transform legitimately excluded.

`build_silver_for_run` drops records without an NCT ID and keeps only the
first occurrence of a repeated one, so "silver rows == bronze records" is the
wrong expectation for any run that had either. Reconciliation needs that exact
figure to stay a real data-loss guard without failing on legitimate dedup, so
the transform records its exclusions here instead of every caller re-deriving
them from the Parquet.
